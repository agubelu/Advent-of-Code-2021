# Advent of Code 2021
My solutions in Rust for this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021).

To run: `cargo run --release [days...]`

My personal goal this year is to aim to be able to run all 25 days combined in under 1 second. I'll keep [a journal file](JOURNAL.md) updated with the different strategies used for every day.
