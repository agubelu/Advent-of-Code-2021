# Advent of Code 2021
My solutions in Rust for this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021). My personal goal this year is to aim to be able to run all 25 days combined in under 1 second.

Check out [JOURNAL.md](JOURNAL.md), where I show the runtimes and discuss the approaches that I used for every day!

To run: `cargo run --release [days...]`
