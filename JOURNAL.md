# AoC 2021 journal

As stated, my goal is to minimize the runtime of all days without deviating *too much* from idiomatic Rust. The extremely scientific methodology I'll follow will be to run each day a bunch of times in my computer and write down the [minimal](https://stackoverflow.com/a/43939840) runtime I get.

I'll keep updating this file with some commentary and discussion every day.
